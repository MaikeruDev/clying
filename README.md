The game unfolds in rounds, each comprising multiple stages:

#### a. Description or Evil Emoji

In the first stage of a round, one player receives a random picture or an evil emoji. If you're the lucky one with the picture, you must craft a description that provides subtle hints without revealing the whole truth. But if you have the evil emoji, your task is to come up with a creative story that matches the emoji's devious nature.

#### b. Descriptive Discussion

Players take turns to share their descriptions or stories based on whether they received a picture or an evil emoji. Pay close attention to details, and remember, clever lies can lead you to victory!

#### c. Voting Stage

After the discussion, it's time for the voting stage. Players cast their votes on who they believe was lying or who had the evil emoji. Choose wisely, as your vote can affect your points.
